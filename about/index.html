      <h3>A Little Moba History</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <br />
      <p>
        The Museum Of Bad Art (MOBA) is a community-based, private institution dedicated to the collection, preservation, exhibition and celebration of bad art in all its forms and in all its glory.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        MOBA was founded in the fall of 1993 and presented its first show in March 1994. The response was overwhelming. Since then, MOBA's collection and ambitions have grown exponentially.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Initially, MOBA was housed in the basement of a private home in Boston. This meager exhibition space limited the museum to being a regional cultural resource for the New England area.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        As the only museum dedicated to bringing the worst of art to the widest of audiences we felt morally compelled to explore new, more creative ways of bringing this priceless collection of quality bad art to a global audience. Another Boston-area cultural institution, Dedham Community Theatre, generously allowed MOBA the use of their basement. Our first permanent gallery is now conveniently located just outside the menâ€™s room in a 1927 movie theatre. The ambience created such a convivial atmosphere, that when we went looking for a second location, the only place that was up to our quality standards was another theatre basement. The Somerville Theater in Davis Square, Somerville MA is now our second gallery.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        To this end, we now exhibit online (you found it!), publish an email newsletter called MOBA News, and offer the popular book Museum of Bad Art : Masterworks.

        Yes there is. In addition to our website at www.museumofbadart.org, there is a permanent gallery in Massachusetts, USA. You can get the address, directions, and maps here. MOBA's permanent collection has over 250 pieces and is stored in a secure warehouse near Boston. About 25 works are exhibited at a time in our gallery in the basement of the Dedham Community Theater. Admission is always free.
